## :desktop_computer: Professional Experience

I currently work as a student researcher under the supervision of Brian B Moser and Prof. Dr. Andreas Dengel at DFKI Kaiserslautern. My work here focuses on <b>Diffusion Models</b> and their applications. My latest work aims to reduce the inference time for zero shot image classification using diffusion models. 

I have 2 years of work experience developing <b>recommendation systems</b> for e-commerce clients at [AIEnterprise Inc](https://www.aienterprise.com) Bangalore, India. During my time there, I have designed and developed models to perform upselling and cross-selling of products on e-commerce websites. Additionally, I have contributed to improving query searches on these websites. 

Apart from this, I have research and technical writing experience in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning with an emphasis on AI Ethics under the mentorship of Prof. Dr. Sebastian Vollmer as a former member of his [Data Science and its Applications (DSA)](https://sebastian.vollmer.ms/) group. 

## ðŸ˜¸ Other Interests 

When I'm not being a techie, I enjoy cooking, reading, gardening and crocheting. I also enjoy travelling and experiencing different cultures of the world.
